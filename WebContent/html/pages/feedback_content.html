                  <p>This TV series is magnificent! I read a book and I must say that A Game Of Thrones is one of the best books I've read. So when I first heard that HBO will do a series on the this book I was thrilled but I was afraid that they will not
                    be done exactly by the book. But I must say that I was wrong and that the series is better than I thought it would be. Much better! While I watched the first episode I had the same excitement as the time when I first read the book.
                    HBO has done a great job and they fulfill all my expectations. Sean Bean was born for the role of Eddard Stark. Costumes, scenes, actors, everything is done as it should be. Actors are perfect for the role they play in the series.
                    For me the biggest surprise of the series I figure Daenerys Targaryen. Emilia Clarke actress who plays Daenerys Targaryen is more beautiful than I imagined it would be and more beautiful than is described in the book. The Wall is a
                    lot different than I had imagined, but in a good way. The series revolves around Eddard Stark and his family. He has a wife and five children, three sons and two daughters. Eddard Stark is ruler of the North and close friend of King
                    Robert who needs his help in ruling the Seven Kingdoms. The seven kingdoms, united under one ruler, have lived a life of peace and comfort since King Robert took the throne. But nothing is ever as it seems. Within the king's court
                    there is murder and treason, with no one aware of what is really going on. Across the seas, the last remnants of the previous royal family gather forces to reclaim their throne. To the north, the unthinkable gathers, the creatures
                    of myth and legend that have been forgotten.</p>

                  <p>Seeing a review comparing this brilliant title to Lord of the Rings made me make an account here and post my very first review. I had very high expectations from this series and I believed that it will (like most TV series) absolutely
                    ruin the book. And I couldn't have been more wrong! Where do I start... The cast is great, though not amazing with one exception - Sean Bean is perfect for the role of cold master of the North, Eddard Stark. The setting, the atmosphere
                    is perfect and not boring at all! Some scenes are just amazing and are exactly as written in the book - for example the scene where they find the wolves, the nature and the dialogs are just as they should be. Now to get to the part
                    most people are interested in: What is this? What can I expect of the series? THIS IS NOT LORD OF THE RINGS. Now that I got that out, I can continue. The very idea behind the series is a lot different. It's based around great families
                    on different sides of the world, the stories their members have to tell and the secrets they hide. And there are many secrets, You will have a chance to witness small portion of them in the first episode. If you cannot follow the story
                    just yet, don't worry! It's meant to be like that, you will eventually get to know all the characters and get involved in the story so much you will BEG for next episode just to see what happens. What to expect? Plots, love, action,
                    war, hatred, quite a few surprises and much much more... All that after the first episode. I really hope they will not ruin it as the series progress. Conclusion: Do not miss this! Yes YOU complaining that the book is better. And everyone
                    else.

                  <p>This show is superb! While I may be bias as the book series is my favourite book series of all, I still think the show itself is fantastic! It sticks loyally to the books and doesn't "dumb things down" for a wider audience. If you are
                    worried you won't gain the same experience by watching the show before you read the books, fear not - It's the same experience, with a different medium! Although, I guarantee, soon you will be so pulled into the world of Westeros you
                    will run out and buy the books just to find out what happens next! Sit back and enjoy, my friends - Winter is Coming!
